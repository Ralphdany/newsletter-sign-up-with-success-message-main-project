### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS DOM properties


### What I learned

In this project,  I learned how to use javascript for email validation using Regex.

The following is a basic Regex expression for Email validtion:

"/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/"






### Continued development

Still having some issues with JS DOM manipulation, but I'm it's just a matter of practicing 

### Useful resources

- [ resource 1](https://www.Stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for the Regex I used for my email validation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
